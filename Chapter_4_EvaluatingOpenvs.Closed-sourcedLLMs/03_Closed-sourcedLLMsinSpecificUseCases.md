## How to Select Closed-Source LLMs?

### Categories of Closed-Source LLMs:

1. **Third-Party Closed-Source LLM Models**:

   - **OpenAI Model**
   - **Cohere LLM Model**

2. **In-House Built LLM Models**:
   - Appropriate when:
     - Open-source models do not meet specific requirements.
     - Developing new research involving highly sensitive data.
