### What is a Generative AI (GenAI)?

- Brief History of
- Using ML models to generate content
- Typical moudel includes:
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - LLM
  - diffusion
- Creation with some level of Creativity (from AIGC to AIGX)

# LLM - A New Computing Platform

- [ ] First principle thinking
- [ ] Reasoning and Creation: New computing platform
- [ ] Emerging capability
- [ ] Continuous learning

| Feature        | Emerging Capabilities                                           | Transfer Learning                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | New abilities that machine learning models can learn to perform | Technique for using a pre-trained model to solve a new problem             |
| **Enabled by** | New advances in machine learning algorithms or hardware         | Pre-trained model                                                          |
| **Examples**   | Generating realistic images, translating languages fluently     | Recognizing objects in images, classifying text, predicting customer churn |

# 3 Key Factors of LLMs

- [ ] **Big Corpus of Data** (from deductive reasoning to inductive reasoning, a lot of data is required, including Prompts)
- [ ] **Models** (deep learning, ChatGPT has a lot of innovation and improvement in engineering)
- [ ] **Computing Power** (requires a large number of GPUs, ChatGPT uses 10,000 Nvidia GPUs and 280,000 CPUs) â€“ Capital intensive

# 3 Types of AI

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** AI systems designed for specific tasks or functions, lacking general intelligence.

- **General AI (Strong AI or AGI):** AI systems with human-like intelligence, capable of understanding and performing various tasks.

- **Superintelligent AI:** Hypothetical AI systems that surpass human intelligence, raising ethical and existential concerns.
