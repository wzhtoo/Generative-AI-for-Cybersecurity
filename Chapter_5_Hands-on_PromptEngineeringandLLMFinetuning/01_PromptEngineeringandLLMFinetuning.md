# Prompt Engineering Examples for Cybersecurity

## Key Components of Prompt Engineering

1. **Prompt Engineering Review**:

   - A systematic evaluation of prompts to ensure they are effective in achieving desired results.
   - Helps optimize AI-generated outputs by refining prompt structures.

2. **Role-playing**:

   - Simulate specific scenarios by assigning a role to the AI.
   - Examples:
     - AI as a **Cybersecurity Analyst** for vulnerability assessments.
     - AI as an **Incident Responder** for breach analysis.

3. **System Message**:

   - Define how the AI should behave in the interaction by setting rules and boundaries.
   - Example:
     - _"You are an expert in cybersecurity providing detailed steps to mitigate phishing attacks."_

4. **User Instruction and Examples**:

   - Provide clear instructions with a few examples to set expectations for the AI's response.
   - Example:
     - _"Review the AWS IAM policy below and highlight any misconfigurations. Provide a summary in bullet points."_

5. **Context**:

   - Include background information or necessary details to ensure accurate and relevant outputs.
   - Example: Add details such as **log files**, **incident timestamps**, or **user behaviors** to help AI generate precise recommendations.

6. **Query (User Input)**:

   - The main input or question the user provides to the AI for a specific task.
   - Examples:
     - _"Analyze this email thread for phishing attempts."_
     - _"Identify the most likely root cause of this server crash based on the logs provided."_

7. **Output Formatting**:

   - Specify the format in which the AI should deliver its results.
   - Examples:
     - Tables, JSON, bulleted lists, or detailed paragraphs.
     - _"Provide a table with columns for Severity, Cause, and Recommendations."_

8. **Constraints**:

   - Define limits to make responses focused and relevant.
   - Example:
     - _"Analyze entries only for the time period between Nov 10 and Nov 15."_

9. **Temperature and Max Tokens**:
   - **Temperature**: Controls randomness and creativity in AI responses.
     - Lower values (e.g., `0.2`) make responses more deterministic.
     - Higher values (e.g., `0.8`) allow more creative outputs.
   - **Max Tokens**: Limits the response length, ensuring concise outputs.

## Practical Examples for Cybersecurity

### 1. **Incident Response**

- **Scenario**: Use AI to assist in analyzing and responding to cybersecurity incidents.
- **Example**:
  - Identify root causes of incidents.
  - Generate reports with actionable steps.

### 2. **Prompt Injection**

- **Scenario**: Test vulnerabilities in prompt engineering, such as **prompt injection attacks**.
- **Example**:
  - Examine whether AI behavior can be manipulated via malicious input.

### 3. **AWS IAM Policy Review**

- **Scenario**: Analyze AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to identify over-permissive configurations or misconfigurations.
- **Example**:
  - Evaluate roles and permissions.
  - Recommend adhering to the principle of least privilege.

### 4. **ChatGPT Code Interpreter Use Case**

- **Scenario**: Utilize AI's code interpreter capabilities to analyze data and logs for anomalies.
- **Example**:
  - Process datasets for trends or outliers, such as **healthcare data breaches**.

## Additional Insights for Practical Use

- **Incident Contextualization**:

  - Include detailed information about:
    - Systems affected.
    - Type of breach (e.g., malware, phishing).
    - Logs or monitoring data.
  - Example:
    - Add timestamps or event IDs to narrow down the analysis scope.

- **Mitigating Prompt Injection Risks**:

  - Validate user input before processing.
  - Avoid exposing sensitive prompts directly in open systems.
  - Test prompts for security vulnerabilities.

- **Policy Reviews for Cloud**:

  - Ensure **IAM policies** adhere to security standards.
  - Check for any **wildcard permissions** or overly broad rules.
  - Example:
    - Highlight misconfigured rules and provide remediation steps.

- **Dataset Analysis**:
  - Provide structured data in formats like CSV or Excel for easy AI parsing.
  - Examples:
    - Analyze **login attempts** for brute force patterns.
    - Detect anomalies in system logs.
