# Adversarial Attack Mitigation

Adversarial attacks target machine learning models and vector databases by exploiting vulnerabilities in their training, deployment, or inference processes. Below, we discuss common attack types and strategies to mitigate them effectively.

---

## Types of Adversarial Attacks

### 1. **Data Poisoning**

- **Definition**: Manipulating training data to compromise the model’s performance or introduce biased behaviors.
- **Impact**:
  - Models may produce incorrect predictions.
  - Vulnerabilities may be embedded during training, which can be exploited later.
- **Example**: Injecting mislabeled or malicious data into a dataset used for supervised learning.

### 2. **Model Stealing**

- **Definition**: Extracting proprietary model architecture, weights, or training data using repeated queries to the model API.
- **Impact**:
  - Intellectual property theft.
  - Stolen models may be used to launch further attacks or for malicious purposes.
- **Example**: Using black-box queries to reconstruct a model via reverse engineering.

---

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. **Adversarial Training**
